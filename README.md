# Human Rights First: Asylum Report Generator

## North Star
- A search tool to give a user-friendly view into a large dataset of asylum case decisions.
- Similar to the [TRAC](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/asylum/) database—a popular existing tool, but with many limitations.
    - Generate a real-time visualization of outcomes, and a real-time graph to represent what the trend looks like over time.
    - Show a heatmap where users can map out e.g., “Here are the 10 asylum regions with the highest or lowest grant rates.”
    - Need to be able to download search results.

## Audiences
- Journalists
- Researchers
- General public (asylum seekers, activists, etc.)

## Users
- Administrators
    - Engineers who interact directly with infra (don’t need user auth)
    - Add/manage data
- Public Users
    - Don’t need to log in—just view and use the public web app
    - Display calendar dates vs. fiscal years in data (display “month and year” and “fiscal year” as separate search)
    - Can view on pre-populated geographic regions based on sets of countries for search parameters
    - View percentage of cases that were granted based on currently displayed results
    - Should be able to save or print reports, charts, and/or graphs generated from a query

## Resources

**The Setup for this project will require a new LTS Version of NodeJS to be installed Node Version 20.x works well for this purpose.**

The following deployed site shows your exact deliverable and what you should be building:
 - [Asylum Front End](https://asylum-fe.vercel.app)

This is what the raw data looks like from HRF:
